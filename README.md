LightSpeed

Milestone Project 2
Interactive Front-End
Development

## Description

* LightSpeed is a game designed to be fun, enjoyable and a light-hearted way to pass the time. Although slightly challenging the game can be beneficial to cognitive abilities and can be played anywhere, anytime and by any ages. 

 

## User Experience (UX)

### First Time Visitor Goals

As a First Time Visitor - As a game player I want a game that is visually appealing and fun = The game is based on the retro arcade or early computer games and the graphics and colour choices should reflect this.
* As a First Time Visitor - As a game player I want a game that is easy to understand while still testing my cognitive abilities = The game is a very straightforward memory game with a random sequence that changes the game with each attempt. 
* As a First Time Visitor – As a game player I want to be entertained and to enjoy the experience = The game can be a personal challenge or just help pass the time.



### Returning/Frequent Visitor Goals

* As a Returning Visitor – I would like the game to stay familiar = In it's current form the game, rules or design, do not change.
* As a Returning Visitor - I want to play the game whenever I wish = the game can be played on desktop, tablet or mobile. 
* As a Returning Visitor – I want the game to continue to be a challenge = The random sequence of the game ensures that no two levels will be the same.


## Design

### General design

* The game has a space style image set as a background to invoke a retro feel to the game. the circle of the game buttons represent planets, and also correspond with the planets in the background image. When the start button is pressed the rules/steps of the game are shown as the player progresses. 

### Colour Scheme

* The game has a light and colourful background (#9fadb2), text colour of black (#000) and white (#fafafa), with the main game buttons in different shades of purple (#d111df, #5c036d, #efc0f2 ), green (#35df5f, #1b8019, #b4eec0), blue (#5f5de5, #a8def5, #020c5a) and orange (#dd6b1f, #f7d19c, #a32d05).

### Typography

* The main font used for the game is Press Start 2P as this provides an early computer/arcade game style -  [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P]

### Imagery

## Wireframes

* The initial concept of the wireframe design was to resemble/recreate the style of the now retro arcade or early computer game. The game buttons match the squares in the background image. There is a start button below the buttons, and a progress panel below that where player progress would be shown. the intention was to have a drop-down menu on the right of the screen to state the rules of the game.

* Jest: Steps take to install Jest * (1) To set up the new npm package type 'npm init' 
                                   * (2) To install type 'npm install --save-dev jest'  
                                   * (3) Follow the instuctions and questions in the terminal
                                   * (4) Build tests
                                   * (5) Run tests by typing 'npm test'
* I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of Jest tests would be more comprehensive.
