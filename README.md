## Description

## User Experience (UX)

### First Time Visitor Goals

As a First Time Visitor - As a game player I want a game that is visually appealing and fun = The game is based on the retro arcade or early computer games and the graphics and colour choices should reflect this.
* As a First Time Visitor - As a game player I want a game that is easy to understand while still testing my cognitive abilities = A very straightforward memory game with a random sequence that changes the game with each attempt. 
* As a First Time Visitor – As a game player I want to be entertained and to enjoy the experience = The game can be a personal challenge or just help pass the time.



### Returning/Frequent Visitor Goals

* As a Returning Visitor – I would like the game to stay familiar = In it's current form the game, rules or design, do not change.
* As a Returning Visitor - I want to play the game whenever I wish = the game can be played on desktop, tablet or mobile. 
* As a Returning Visitor – I want the game to continue to be a challenge = The random sequence of the game ensures that no two levels will be the same.

* The initial concept of the wireframe design was to resemble/recreate the style of the now retro arcade or early computer game. The game buttons match the squares in the background image. There is a start button below the buttons and a progress panel below that, where player progress would be shown. the intention was to have a drop-down menu on the right of the screen to state the rules of the game.
